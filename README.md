<p id="about"></p>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ ABOUT 

This project is a summary of knowledge gained during course module on JavaScript Fundamental and Interactive Front-End Development, to build a simple single memory game and to comply to all four phases of software development which are 
<br>
<ul>
  <li>1.Initial phase</li>
  <li>2. Planning phase</li>
  <li>3. Execution phase</li>
  <li>4. Deployment phase</li>
</ul>

In this this documentation, <br> I will provide 
a. Reader with full justification and inspiration behind my choice of this special and unique game
b. User with full explanation on how to benefit from the game 
c. User with scoring counter to allow the participant to build up points of progression.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ PURPOSE

<p id="purpose"></p>


The purpose of this game is to provide an inclusive educational memory game for users 
i. with Hearing-loss
ii. without Hearing-loss
in improving their literacy, communication and cognitive skills in an interactive environment.



## 3Ô∏è‚É£ STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT

<p id="stages"></p>

AS A USER
1. As a user, I want to interact with the game that will allow me to learn amd memorise English words with British Sign Language [BSL] to improve my literacy, communication and cognitive skills. 
- The main purpose of the game is to :
a. improve communication skill of children and young adult who have hearing-loss 
b. influence in reducing the impact of mental health among this minority due to social magilisation.  The user can click the mouse to initialise the arrow to the centre of the dart board which consist of random BSL video and English words.
2. As a user, I want to know how playing memory games can improve cognitive, communication and literacy skills.
- Information about the benefits of playing memory games can be found in the PURPOSE.
3. As a user, I want a laptop/PC game to play whilst in quite environment without distraction and I will be able to practice my communication skill.

4. As a user, I want a game that is intuitive and easy to use so that I can learn how to use it quickly.
- The game is very intuitive to use. In addition player can find how to play info in purpose.
5. As a player, I want to see my score so that I can see if I am making progress.
- Users can keep track of their score by watching the timer, turn count and points while they're playing the game, and see their best scores in best score section in the game. Also if they misses the targer in centre they will be able to see how many chances they have not be a losser but a winner too.
6. As a player, I want a fun game that will attract both hearin and hearing-loss children and young adult to play and help with their cognitive, communication and literacy skills.

#### Developer:

1. As a developer, I want to develop a memory game software  using JavaScript.
- JavaScript is the main language that was used to create the game.
2. As a developer, I want to create fully responsive app to showcase my skills to a potential employer.
- Application is fully responsive thanks to  P5Js framework and mobile first design ap.
3. As a developer, I wanted to create a game that will be inclusive and meet the need of people that are living in isolation as a result of their disability. It had been a dream working in special school and to find resource of interest to meet individual need compare to children and young people of the same age with no disability

### Design:

#### Colour Scheme:

3 primary colours are used which are the main  colours:
- #663F74 
- #000000
- #ffffff

All colours were used to style various elements in application.




#### Content Structure:

The main game geometry of the game is square, it refers in this way to Lego bricks. The game base on two sections and modals. All modals are square and have blue backgrounds. It is very easy solution to make sure all will be good visible on mobile devices.

#### Images:

The main image in main menu section is Emmet which is well know character from Lego movie. It will focus attention around younger and also older players.

  <p id="future"></p>

### Future features:

- Live Play - I'd like to add functionality to allow users to interact and compete with friends or other players with features like a real-time scoreboard and the option to send invites and challenges to other players.
- Variation of Themes - The current theme of the site is geared more towards children than adults, so I'd like create multiple themes so that users can select a theme when they first arrive on the site and their preference would be saved for the next time they visit.

<p id="testing"></p>

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing üî•

<p id="manualtesting"></p>

### Manual Testing:

Only manual testing method was used to test this project due to big gap of knowledge on how to use automatic testing tools like Jasmine or Enzyme yet. All functions were tested by myself by creating different scenarios.

Testing and improving the application was carried out throughout its development. The main testing tool was Google Chrome dev tools and devices such as a phone, tablet and laptop with several versions of browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera).

Passing the HTML file content through the W3C Validator for HTML resulted in no errors but one warning "Section lacks heading" which was game arena section but this is intentional so I ignored. The Bootstrap framework was tested extensively to ensure that the Mobile first Responsive Approach was achieved with this project. The Application was tested on my Lenovo Thinkbook laptop and large Samsung TV screen, Samsung Galaxy S6 mobile and Lenovo tablet. The application worked fine on all devices. If something didn't work as it should during the test it was immediately checked and corrected in DevTools and then implemented into the code and checked again. If test passed it was committed and pushed into repository. 

I used JSHint to validate JavaScript file configured to accept jQuery & ES6 features like const and let variables. There was no major warnings but this test allowed me to see where I had missing semi-colons from block of code and detect unused variables.

CSS file content was regularly checked in the W3C Validator for CSS to ensure any errors were spotted throughout the development of the style sheet. As with the HTML validation if any errors were present they were checked in DevTools and then copy and pasted over to the code before committing and pushing the updated code to my GitHub Repository.
